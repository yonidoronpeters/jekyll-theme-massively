Hi, my name is Yoni and I am a professional software engineer currently working at Thoughtworks. I have mostly backend experience using Java and Spring, but also have experience with Kotlin, Ruby on Rails, Python, and C. I am interested in the renewable energy, cyber security, and fitness technology spaces.
I like to explore new technologies and learn new skills as I work on personal projects. 
I write code using [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) methodology and follow [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) design principles. 
In my free time, I enjoy travel, riding my bike, XC skiing, biathlon, running, weight lifting, and almost anything that involves being outside ðŸ™‚.
