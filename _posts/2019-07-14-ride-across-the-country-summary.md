## The People
After my mom passed away from cancer in late March, 2019 I was pretty devastated. There was no way I could just go back to my "normal" life right after she died. Thankfully, my manager at work is a really incredible person and the company I work for, SAP, has a policy in place just for instances just like this one, so I was able to take almost 4 months off from work and dedicate some time to myself. It was pretty clear to me that I had to do something out of the ordinary and that this adventure would 
- really challenge me
- allow for a lot of thinking time
- be possible to do on my own
- take less than 3 months

After coming up with a few ideas such as traveling around Asia or hiking in South America. I realized that what I would really enjoy is traveling by bike. And since I know a couple of people who have biked across the country, it would make the logistics of it much easier. It also seemed like something that I would truely enjoy and be able to do alone. Yet would still be very challenging. I have been riding bikes pretty seriously since I was about 12 years old. But have never taken a multi day trip where there was a need to camp or carry my own gear. So I called my good friend Rob Helvestine, who offered up lots of good advice and guidance. 

Fast forward 2.5 months and here we are. I completed the journey on June 30th and would like to update you with how it went. 
To start, it definitely achieved its purpose of helping me come to terms with the new reality that my mom is gone and life will be different going forward. It was really hard at first to be alone and think about her all the time. But it was just what I needed. I highly recommend going on a journey like that if you are grieving someone as it allowed for ample processing time. The fact that you are doing something challenging and have a goal (e.g. riding across the country) keeps you busy and focused on achiving that goal as opposed to only mourning and focusing solely on your loss.

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/milford_hosts.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>There were also some unexpected consequenses to doing this trip. First and foremost is my new optimistic outlook on life. Specifically my renewed trust in people. If you ever lose faith in humanity, go on a bike trip across the country. It will prove to you how good people can be. Growing up, I was tought to be very wary of people I don't know. Never take anything from strangers, don't talk to strangers, and definitely don't trust strangers. I spent most of my life following those guidelines. But on this trip, I was by myself and if I didn't talk to strangers, well, I then I wouldn't talk to anyone... In addition, Rob encouraged me to sign up to [warmshowers.org](https://www.warmshowers.org){:target="_blank"} and find hosts that will take me in for the night. Warmshowers is a platform that introduces multi day bike riders to hosts that will let them take a warm shower in their home. More often than not the hosts will also offer a comfy bed, dinner, and even breakfast. I wrote more about this amazing community [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/BxdWg2sB57-/){:target="_blank"}. Point is, people on warmshowers are complete strangers to one another. Yet these amazing hosts still opened their homes to me, introduced their children to me, and left me alone at their house, all with total confidence that I won't do anything mallicious. Seeing that over and over along the trip (I spent 21 nights with warmshower hosts!) had a really powerful effect on me. It's true that the people who sign up to warmshowers are truely special. Not all strangers are <b>this</b> nice. But still, everywhere I rode my bike, people were really interested in where I was from, which way I was headed, and why I was doing this trip. They gave me advice on which roads to take, and wished me a safe journey. This happened mostly in rural places and small towns which my route took me on. And especially in states where I thought people would be less nice to cyclists. Some of those states voted for a candidate I completely disagree with. People there were actually the kindest. For example, the drivers in Kentucky were the most bicycle friendly in my experience (with Virginia coming in close second). They would never pass in blind corners, or zoom by very closely as the passed, and definitely <i>never, ever</i> honk. They would just wait patiently behind me until it was completely safe to pass, and often wave as they drove past. One driver even saved me from a few teritorially aggressive dogs by scarying the dogs away while they were chasing me. Another driver (in Illinois) stopped at a top of a climb to hand me an ice cold bottle of water on a really hot day. Those random acts of kindness really had a strong effect on me. Sometimes it feels like humanity is on the verge of collapse. At least that's the story a lot of the media is trying to tell us. However, the people I met on this journey have really restored my faith in people.

## Best Part of the Trip
<span class="image right"><img src="{{ "/images/bryce.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>Well, if you haven't noticed yet, the favorite part about this trip was meeting new people along the way. But the second best part is seeing the country in a way I have never seen it before. On this trip, I traveled to many small towns that I would probably never visit if it wasn't for this trip. I got to experience rural America and all the good and bad associated with it. There were also lots of amazing views along the way. Virginia and Kentucky surprised me with their incredible lush green forests. Missouri was also very pretty through the Ozarks (though incredibly steep!). Even Kansas with its endless wheat crops had its own magic. Though my absolute favorite was Utah, with its diverse and completely out of this world views of canyons, rock formations, incredible colors, and even green and snowy mountains. Those views left me completely in awe and I am ready to be back and explore more of the parks and nature this beautiful state has to offer.

## Worst Part of the Trip
<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/bad_food.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>Well, there were many bad parts to the trip. Insane amounts of mosquitoes in Illinois, annoying gnats in Utah, aggressive drivers in Colorado and California, non-stop rain for a day in Virginia, absolutely relentness headwinds in Nevada, and long stretches of road without services. But honestly, non of it was really that bad. These challenges were all just good character builders that made me stronger in the long run (except for the aggressive drivers, I could do without those). Some part of the country also has no access to decent food. Including some rural towns that only have a Dollar General for a grocery store and are basically food deserts. If you have never been to a Dollar General, they don't just have things for $1 any more, they sell actual food. But all of it overly processed and packaged. No fresh fruits or vegetabales of any kind. Many of the restaurants in those towns had very limited options too so I ended up eating fried chicken every day for almost a week.

## conclusion
<span class="image right"><img src="{{ "/images/family.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>Would I recommend this trip to anyone? <b>Most definitely!</b> This was the biggest adventure of my life so far and I already have a few more bike packing trips in mind which I would like to do within the next few years. What if you are not a cyclist? That doesn't matter. Most other riders I met on the trip were not serious cyclists. Some of them haven't biked since they were young kids, some are weekend wariors but have never ridden any serious mileage before. A large percentage of them are also over 60 years old. So really anyone can do it. It will probably take you longer, but still very much possible. 

Despite doing the ride "unsupported", meaning I carried my own gear througout the trip and was self sufficient. It wasn't <i>really</i> unsupported. I would have never been able to do this ride without the support of strangers who opened their house to me on warmshowers.org and let me rinse the day's sweat and sunscreen, who fed me large amounts of delicous food, and allowed me to spend the night in the comfort of a bed and out of the elements. I would have never been able to do this without strangers who did random acts of kindness, like handing me water on a really hot day. I would have never been able to do this without support of my girlfriend, family, and friends who kept the moral high and made sure I didn't feel lonely. And finally, I would have never been able to do this without the rest of the riders out on the roads who I really enjoyed meeting and made me feel like I am a part of a great community.

If you would like to become and warmshowers host and meet some really cool and interesting people, you can sign up on [warmshowers.org](https://www.warmshowers.org){:target="_blank"}. I can tell you that I am very excited to become a host myself now that my trip is over. If you can't be a host but would still like to support this awesome idea, you can donate to warmshowers in order to help them keep the website up and running.
