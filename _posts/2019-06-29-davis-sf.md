Tomorrow is the big day. The last day of this crazy, long journey. I played that day in my head so many times throughout
the last few weeks. I’m sorry if it seems confusing but I fell behind on the posts and finally caught up with all of
them. The ride plan for today seemed pretty easy. Something like 60mi of downhill and then about 75mi of flat roads. But
the legs are fatigued and there was still a bit of climbing in order to get out of Kirkwood. Hopefully the legs can hold
up for just one more day. The scenery by Kirkwood reminds me a lot of Colorado. The rocks, trees, and lakes all resemble
what you see in the Rockies. But as I was going down the other side of the Sierras, the scenery drastically changes.
Golden grass with lots of oak trees everywhere and winding roads remind me a lot of riding down Mt. Diablo (outside
Berkeley). All of a sudden it felt like I was really close to finishing. About 85mi in I got on the bike trail along the
American River. I remember doing a triathlon there a few years ago and even recognized the part of the path the race was
on. I didn’t realize just how long that path is. I was probably on it for about 35mi today. And it keeps on going in
both directions! There are also lots of different water sports people do on the river. I saw paddle boards, canoes,
motorboats, and people swimming. The last part into Davis was a bit windy and I was glad to finally make it to my next
warmshowers host. Matt did the same route I’m doing in 2007 but going eastbound. He also brought his 13 y/o son, Yonah,
and carried his 5 y/o son, Solomon the entire way across the country! The trip happened because Yonah didn’t want to
celebrate his Bar Mitzvah (he was an atheist since he was 5) and said he would rather bike across the country instead.
The the family went on this long and crazy adventure. Matt wrote a book about the trip called “The Bar Mitzvah and the
Beast”. He also gave me a signed copy of it! What amazing people you meet on this journey
