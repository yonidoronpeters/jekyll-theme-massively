## The Bike
People ride all kinds of different bikes and setups on the cross country trip. From road bike, to mountain bikes, and everything in between including touring, gravel, and even recumbent bikes. Despite a few recommendations from people to get a touring specific bike for this trip so I can mount panniers on it, I decided to ride a more performance oriented bike instead, specifically a gravel bike. I figured that I can get away with carrying the bare minimum and use a bikepacking setup consisting of a saddle bag, handlebar bag, and frame bag. This would help keep the weight down and allow me to ride longer days and therefore finish the journey faster. It would also mean that if I did get a new bike, it would serve me well after the trip is over. I also considered using my current low-end aluminum cyclocross bike. Definitely the cheaper option, but probably not the best in terms of comfort. Since I enjoy riding gravel so much these days, it made sense to invest in a new carbon gravel bike. Why use a gravel bike instead of a road bike? 
1. Comfort - riding 5-9hrs a day on a road bike is not very comfortable. The position on a road bike is a bit too aggressive which could lead to back pain and tired upper body. The other reason gravel bike is more comfortable is that the frame is meant to be a bit more forgiving and absorb some of the ground vibrations. Also, skinnier tires means more road vibrations going up the frame and all the way to your body which on a long day can be very uncomfortable. Since gravel bikes have wider tire clearance, it means you can run wider tires than you can on a road bike and therefore lower pressure in your tires. That will absorb much of the road vibrations.
2. Build/sturdiness - gravel bikes are built to sustain harsher conditions than road bikes. Be it gravel, rocks, potholes, or just bad asphalt. When riding on a rough road, the frame and wheels on a gravel bike are more likely to hold up against the harsh conditions. This is especially important when you have extra weight in the form of touring bags.
3. Handlebar width - gravel bikes tend to have wider handlebars. Usually the drops are angled out to create even more space between the two ends of the bars. This allows for more comfort as well the advantage of being able to fit a larger handlebar bag. The bike I ended up getting actually has really funky handlebars - I will come back to that later.
That was enough to convince me that it makes since to buy a new bike. Besides, new bike is always the good option [(n+1 rule)](provide/link/to/rule){:target="_blank"}.




<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/milford_hosts.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>There were also some unexpected consequences to doing this trip. First and foremost is my new optimistic outlook on life. Specifically, my renewed trust in people. If you ever lose faith in humanity, go on a bike trip across the country. It will prove to you how good people can be. Growing up, I was taught to be very wary of people I don't know. Never take anything from strangers, don't talk to strangers, and definitely don't trust strangers. I spent most of my life following those guidelines. But on this trip, I was by myself and if I didn't talk to strangers, well, then I wouldn't talk to anyone... Rob encouraged me to sign up to [warmshowers.org](https://www.warmshowers.org){:target="_blank"} and find hosts that will take me in for the night. Warmshowers is a platform that introduces multi day bike riders to hosts that will let them take a warm shower in their home. More often than not, the hosts will also offer a comfy bed, dinner, and even breakfast. I wrote more about this amazing community [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/BxdWg2sB57-/){:target="_blank"}. Point is, people on warmshowers are complete strangers to one another, yet these amazing hosts open their homes to guests like myself. They introduced their children to me, and left me alone at their house, all with total confidence that I won't do anything malicious. Seeing that over and over along the trip (I spent 19 nights with warmshower hosts!) had a really powerful effect on me. It's true that the people who sign up to warmshowers are truly special. Not all strangers are <b>this</b> nice. But still, everywhere I rode my bike, many of the people I encountered were genuinely interested in where I was from, which way I was headed, and why I was doing this trip. They gave me advice on which roads to take, and wished me a safe journey. This happened mostly in rural places and small towns I rode through. Including states I thought people would be less nice to cyclists. Some of those states voted overwhelmingly for a candidate I completely disagree with. However, people there were actually the kindest. For example, the drivers in Kentucky were the most bicycle friendly in my experience (with Virginia coming in a close second). They would never pass in blind corners, or zoom by very closely as the passed, and definitely <i>never, ever</i> honk. They would just wait patiently behind me until it was completely safe to pass, and often wave as they drove past. One driver even saved me from a few territorially aggressive dogs by scaring the dogs away while they were chasing me. Another driver (in Illinois) stopped at the top of a steep climb to hand me an ice cold bottle of water on a blazing hot day. These random acts of kindness really impacted me. Sometimes it feels like humanity is on the verge of collapse, at least that's the story much of the media is telling us. However, the people I met on this journey have really restored my faith in humanity.

## Best Part of the Trip
<span class="image right"><img src="{{ "/images/bryce.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>Well, if you haven't noticed yet, my favorite part about this trip was meeting new people along the way. But the second best part is seeing the country in a way I have never seen it before. On this trip, I traveled to many small towns that I would probably never have visited. I got to experience rural America and many of the good and bad parts associated with it. There were also lots of amazing views along the way. Virginia and Kentucky surprised me with their incredible lush green forests. Missouri was also very pretty through the Ozarks (though incredibly steep!). Even Kansas with its endless wheat crops had its own magic. Though my absolute favorite was Utah, with its diverse and completely out of this world views of canyons, rock formations, incredible colors, and even green and snowy mountains. Those views left me completely in awe and I am ready to be back and explore more of the parks and nature this beautiful state has to offer.

## Worst Part of the Trip
<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/bad_food.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>Well, there were many bad parts to the trip. Insane amounts of mosquitoes in Illinois, annoying gnats in Utah, aggressive drivers in Colorado and California, non-stop rain for a day in Virginia, absolutely relentless headwinds in Nevada, and long stretches of road without services. But honestly, none of it was really that bad. These challenges were all just good character builders that made me stronger in the long run (except for the aggressive drivers, I could do without those). Some parts of the country also have no access to decent food. Including some rural towns that only have a [Dollar General for a grocery store](https://www.npr.org/2017/12/11/569815331/loving-and-hating-dollar-general-in-rural-america){:target="_blank"} and are basically food deserts. If you have never been to a Dollar General, they don't just have things for $1 any more, they sell actual food. But all of it overly processed and packaged. No fresh fruits or vegetables of any kind. Many of the restaurants in those towns had very limited options so I ended up eating fried chicken every day for almost a week.

## conclusion
<span class="image right"><img src="{{ "/images/family.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>Would I recommend this trip to anyone? <b>Most definitely!</b> This was the biggest adventure of my life so far and I already have a few more bike packing trips in mind which I would like to do within the next few years. What if you are not a cyclist? That doesn't matter. Most other riders I met on the trip were not serious cyclists. Some of them haven't biked since they were young kids, some are weekend warriors but have never ridden any serious mileage before. A large percentage of them are also over 60 years old. So really anyone can do it. It will probably take you longer, but still very much possible. 

Despite doing the ride "unsupported", meaning I carried my own gear throughout the trip and was self sufficient. It wasn't <i>really</i> unsupported. I would have never been able to do this ride without the support of strangers who opened their house to me on warmshowers.org and let me rinse the day's sweat and sunscreen, who fed me large amounts of delicious food, and allowed me to spend the night in the comfort of a bed and out of the elements. I would have never been able to do this without strangers who did random acts of kindness, like handing me water on a really hot day. I would have never been able to do this without the support of my girlfriend, family, and friends who kept the moral high and made sure I didn't feel lonely. And finally, I would have never been able to do this without the rest of the riders out on the roads who I really enjoyed meeting and made me feel like I am a part of a great community.

If you would like to become a warmshowers host and meet some really cool and interesting people, you can sign up on [warmshowers.org](https://www.warmshowers.org){:target="_blank"}. I can tell you that I am very excited to become a host myself now that my trip is over. If you can't be a host but would still like to support this awesome idea, you can donate to warmshowers in order to help them keep the website up and running.

Throughout her life, my mom has donated to many great non-profit organizations.

## What's next?
Since this trip was so rewarding, I already started thinking about my next long distance bike trip, even as I was still riding across the country. There are a few more trips I would like to do in the U.S., such as the western part of the TransAmerica Trail which I missed due to getting on the Western Express route. There is a lot more of Utah that I would like to see, and perhaps other parts of the country in the south and midwest covered by routes like the Underground Railroad. Adventure Cycling Association has a great [interactive map](https://www.adventurecycling.org/routes-and-maps/adventure-cycling-route-network/interactive-network-map/){:target="_blank"} of several routes they came up with. In addition, touring Europe by bike seems like a great way to see the continent. If you have done a fun bike touring adventure and have any suggestions, or have one on your bucket list, please let me know in the comments below.
