psuedo code:

get all posts for time range
while next page isn't empty:
    for each post:
        process post procedure


process post procedure:
    create markdown file
    using the post message -> procces title from the message using regex similar to: "^Day*)\n$". then split that using regex "^d+*)\n$", use the first part as title and the second as excerpt
    extract date from created time (after conversion to local Colorado time) and set on post as date
    Format the message into paragraphs and add to post body
    for each attachments.data.subattachments.data:
       save media.image.src into images folder under a folder with the post date
       Set first image to post image title
       The rest, split nicely into the post using span with image right, left, or fit CSS classes
       write markdown file to _posts folder with title in format: "YYYY-MM-DD-title.md"
